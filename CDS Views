## Creating RAP Models in ABAP (Eclipse)


1. Create Database Table
- this can be found in: core data services → dictionary → database tables
- Here you can define regular key fields, and regular fields
- example:
    -define table z161am_flights {
    key client       : abap.clnt not null;
    key carrierid    : abap.char(3) not null;
    key connectionid : abap.numc(4) not null;
    key flightdate   : abap.dats not null;
    seatsmax         : abap.int4;
    seatsocc         : abap.int4; }


2. Create The Root CDS View
- This can be found in: Core data services →  Data definitions
- Use `define root view entity` to make the view compatible with RAP.
- Now map all fields from the database table to this CDS view
- Example:
    -define root view entity Z_Flight161AM_CDS
    as select from z161am_flights
    {
    key carrierid          as CarrierId,
    key connectionid       as ConnectionId,
    key flightdate         as FlightDate,
    seatsmax           as SeatsMax }
