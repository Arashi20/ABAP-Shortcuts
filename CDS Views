## Creating RAP Models in ABAP (Eclipse)


1. Create Database Table
- this can be found in: core data services → dictionary → database tables
- Here you can define regular key fields, and regular fields

- example:
    -define table z161am_flights {
    key client       : abap.clnt not null;
    key carrierid    : abap.char(3) not null;
    key connectionid : abap.numc(4) not null;
    key flightdate   : abap.dats not null;
    seatsmax         : abap.int4;
    seatsocc         : abap.int4; }


2. Create The Root CDS View
- This can be found in: Core data services →  Data definitions
- Use `define root view entity` to make the view compatible with RAP.
- Now map all fields from the database table to this CDS view

- Example:
    -define root view entity Z_Flight161AM_CDS
    as select from z161am_flights
    {
    key carrierid          as CarrierId,
    key connectionid       as ConnectionId,
    key flightdate         as FlightDate,
    seatsmax           as SeatsMax }


3. Create a Behavior Definition
- The behavior definition specifies how the entity behaves, including CRUD operations and custom actions. This can be found in: Core data services → Behavior Definitions
- You can also add custom actions here
- Example of a program with 3 regular actions and one custom added:
    - **managed implementation in class zbp_flight161am_cds unique;
    strict ( 2 );**
        
        **define behavior for Z_Flight161AM_CDS alias flight
        persistent table Z161AM_FLIGHTS
        lock master
        authorization master ( instance )
        {
        create;
        update;
        delete;**
        
        **action markFullyBooked result [1] $self; // Custom action
        }**
