## Creating RAP Models in ABAP (Eclipse)


1. Create Database Table
- this can be found in: core data services → dictionary → database tables
- Here you can define regular key fields, and regular fields

- example:
    define table z161am_flights {
    key client       : abap.clnt not null;
    key carrierid    : abap.char(3) not null;
    key connectionid : abap.numc(4) not null;
    key flightdate   : abap.dats not null;
    seatsmax         : abap.int4;
    seatsocc         : abap.int4; }


2. Create The Root CDS View
- This can be found in: Core data services →  Data definitions
- Use `define root view entity` to make the view compatible with RAP.
- Now map all fields from the database table to this CDS view

- Example:
    define root view entity Z_Flight161AM_CDS
    as select from z161am_flights
    {
    key carrierid          as CarrierId,
    key connectionid       as ConnectionId,
    key flightdate         as FlightDate,
    seatsmax           as SeatsMax }


3. Create a Behavior Definition
- The behavior definition specifies how the entity behaves, including CRUD operations and custom actions. This can be found in: Core data services → Behavior Definitions
- You can also add custom actions here

- Example of a program with 3 regular actions and one custom added:
    managed implementation in class zbp_flight161am_cds unique;
    strict ( 2 );
        
        define behavior for Z_Flight161AM_CDS alias flight
        persistent table Z161AM_FLIGHTS
        lock master
        authorization master ( instance )
        {
        create;
        update;
        delete;
        
        action markFullyBooked result [1] $self; // Custom action
        }


4. Create a Behavior Class
- Now we have to write some logic. This can be found in the source code library → classes
- You can immediately go to this class, through the previous step (by using a quick fix when selecting the class in the code of the behavior definition
- Here the CRUD methods are not displayed, as they are default actions in the CDS view.
- Any other custom actions that you have defined in the behavior definition, you can see here as methods, and thus, you can add logic to it.



5. Publish the RAP Service
- Create a service definition first.
    1. In Eclipse, go to your RAP project and locate the package where your objects (CDS view, behavior definition) are stored (it’s called core data services)
    2. right-click → other → service definition
    3. Here you create a new service definition, to Expose the root CDS view

    4. Example:
        1. @EndUserText.label: 'Service Definition Custom Flights (Arash)'
            
            define service Z_Flight161AM_Service {
            
            expose Z_Flight161AM_CDS;
            
            }

            
- Create a service Binding
    1. Now right-click the same root package and go to → new → other → service binding
    2. Here, specify your service definition, and the type (OData V4 UI)
    3. Now, activate the service binding
    4. if the backend is all error-free, you are able to right-click on the service binding and see the preview (redirects you to local Fiori url)
